# TP MITRO209 - Algorithms for the Densest-Subgraph Problem

This projects implements two approximation algorithms for the densest-subgraph problem. This project was done for the MITRO209 course at Télécom Paris.

The idea of the first algorithm is presented at slide 10 of `DensestMITRO18.pdf`, though the the data structure that assures its linear time was not given and its development was part of the project. The second algorithm is presented at slide 4 of `streamingDensest.pdf`.

To see a description of the specification of the project, check `TextProjectMItro2020.pdf`. Results are presented in `TP__MITRO209.pdf`.
